CMDread enhances the normal command line editing of CMD.EXE.  It provides more
editing functions and improved file name completion, along with keyboard
shortcuts to most items on the Edit menu.  Symbols and macros can run
frequently used command lines and its own associations can run console-specific
programs.  Macros can also be used to record and play back a sequence of
keystrokes.
